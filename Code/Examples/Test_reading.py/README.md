## Testing

This area is holding code I used to test and gather data for the sensor. This makes use of a 2-axis frame that allows movement of the sensor in 2D space. The code here allows testing of pressure, direction, speeds and meterials.

This controls the axis using a Raspberry Pi Pico kitronics board, a DC motor for x and a stepper motor for y. The use of a dc motor was purely a budget choice rather than scientific.
