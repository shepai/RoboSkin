# RoboSkin
This is a library for interfacing with optical tactile skin sensors for robotics projects.

Sensing an environment is seen within many adaptive agents, and much of this within biology is tactile. High resolution tactile sensing allows environmental sensing over larger surface areas as well as more detailed information about the surfaces. This library has the support for reading interpreting tactile information.
